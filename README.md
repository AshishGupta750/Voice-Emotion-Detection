# Voice-Emotion-Detection
This project implements a machineâ€‘learning pipeline to automatically recognize human emotions from short voice recordings. By extracting key acoustic features and training classification models, it aims to distinguish between several emotional states (e.g., neutral, calm, happy, sad, angry, fearful, disgust, and surprised) with high accuracy.
